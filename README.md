# 📌 Medium Repository - Learning & Building Projects

## 📖 About This Repository
This repository is created to document and share projects related to **Data Engineering, AI Agents, Automation, and Problem Solving**. The goal is to **learn by building**, improve **real-world skills**, and share knowledge through **Medium articles**.

## 📌 Projects Overview

### **1️⃣ Real-Time Data Engineering**
- **Project**: Real-Time Data Processing with Kafka, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL
- **Status**: Ongoing (Medium article series)
- **Purpose**: Understanding real-time data processing, Kafka event streaming, and database integration.
- **Medium Articles**:
  - [Introduction to Real-Time Data Processing](#)
  - [Kafka Producer & Consumer Implementation](#)
  - More to be added as the project progresses.

### **2️⃣ AI Agents & Langchain Exploration**
- **Project**: AI Agent Research & Experiments
- **Status**: Research Phase
- **Purpose**: Learning AI agent frameworks like LangChain and OpenAI GPT APIs.
- **Future Scope**: 
  - Implement AI-based automation workflows.
  - Build a chatbot for real-world applications.
  - Explore multimodal AI agents.
- **Notes**: No structured plan yet, but potential projects are being explored.

### **3️⃣ Challenges & Problem Solving**
- **Project**: Documenting problems and solutions encountered in projects.
- **Status**: To Be Organized
- **Purpose**: Keep a structured record of errors, bugs, and solutions faced during different projects.
- **Implementation**: A separate `challenges` directory is created to categorize problems and their solutions.

### **4️⃣ Future Plans**
- **Immediate Focus**:
  - Completing the **Real-Time Data Engineering** project and documenting it in Medium.
  - Continuing **AI Agent** research and defining a project roadmap.
- **Upcoming Projects**:
  - **Data Pipeline Automation** (ETL, Orchestration with Airflow)
  - **Advanced AI Agent Development**
  - **Problem-Solving Challenges & Case Studies**
