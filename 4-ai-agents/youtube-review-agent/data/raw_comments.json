If that phone was working/replacing/fixing it wasn&#39;t more than the cost of just buying the same phone then I would still be using it. I instead switched to this phone a couple weeks ago since I do like Pixel phones(the features) and it will be updated until 2030. I don&#39;t care to replace my phone if it works so I&#39;m hoping this will last longer than the 5 years my Pixel 3 lasted. I got the Pixel 8 Pro for 350-380$ with the regular model only being 10 dollars less so I opted for this one. <br><br>And first impressions, the mic is subpar(at least in Discord, recording app it seemed fine), the phone is too large(Pixel 3 5.5in vs the Pro 8 6.7in so that&#39;s very apparent which makes it annoying to use the phone, the weight isn&#39;t an issue though) but it is nice for watching YouTube but honestly I would still prefer a smaller sized phone, I like the recording app feature where it condenses what was said and it has speakers labeled but I am only one speaker so I haven&#39;t tested that, I have a nice magnetic case for magsafe and I&#39;m enjoying that but haven&#39;t tested a car holder so can&#39;t say how well it holds up, the front camera is not as good as the Pixel 3 at least in low light conditions(night sight), in the exact same scenario the Pixel 3 night sight front photo was way brighter to where I could clearly see my face, on the 8 Pro I could barely make out my face so it was a major disappointment and the front camera in regular lighting I feel like my face was too defined vs the Pixel 3 had a softer look which I miss, also the lighting it chooses is odd for the front camera, it&#39;s way too white or it will flash blue so I have it set to manual control to fix that, I am unsure if somehow I&#39;m doing something wrong or what, for some reason live caption just won&#39;t work, and active edge is no longer a feature so that is a bummer, no back finger print sensor like on the Pixel 3 and this in screen one is iffy at best, double back tap is nice for taking screenshots or turning on the brightness, the shortcuts on the lockscreen are nice too, I have mine set to flashlight and mute, the temp feature I have only used it twice but I imagine it being useful(one person has used it to test the sidewalk temp for when they take their pets out), the battery is better but this is a new phone with a bigger battery so duh and I turned off high refresh and high resolution so I&#39;m sure that has helped me. The extra zoom on the camera is nice but I haven&#39;t used it much. I would like more control on photos with the camera, I&#39;m not sure what but I feel like something is missing. <br><br>Main takeaway, the features I care about or have tested are either the same or worse so I feel like I have a slightly worse phone than I did with my Pixel 3 except this new one has a better battery but it&#39;s also more clunky(I don&#39;t like big phones, I want to be able to use them one handed with no effort, I WISH they had a proper one handed mode, I hate the one that is used, it just makes it so the top half of your phone goes black, I wish you could make it do that to the side so that it would be brought closer to one side so that reaching across the phone would be easy not just up the phone). The magic eraser, audio erase, video something feature that only the 8 pro has, Gemini and some features like that I haven&#39;t used so maybe I would like that a lot more. This makes it seem like I hate the phone, I don&#39;t, I just didn&#39;t care for an &#39;upgrade&#39;(this almost doesn&#39;t feel like an upgrade) so I might be a little more critical than I normally would be. <br><br>Thoughts anyone has about this is welcome or even help with the microphone would be appreciated. If you like the phone or dislike it, I&#39;m curious as to why. Have a great day!",
